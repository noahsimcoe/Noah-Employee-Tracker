# Noah-Employee-Tracker
Challenge 12

## Description
On this project I demonstrated my ability to create an application that has a MySQL database with tables and fake data that can be seeded inside of it. I also proved my knowledge and understanding of writing different SQL queries to retrieve, create, update, or delete certain types of data per the user's request.

## Installation
This project is NOT deployed on GitHub Pages, but installation and usage of the project can be viewed in the screencastify video linked at the end of the README file.

I used the MySQL2 and the inquirer npm packages while working on this project.

## Usage
This project is used as an example of what the back end of a business's application system would look like if it was in charge of tracking information about their employees, departments, and roles offered. It also shows the overall process of how an application like this can be created and brought up to speed, and how the data inside of it can be manipulated per user input.
